# 📊 Sales Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow where a raw sales dataset is cleaned using **Python** and transformed into an interactive and visually appealing **Power BI Sales Dashboard**. The goal is to help stakeholders quickly understand sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project involves two main stages:

---

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)**

The raw dataset was cleaned using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
Libraries used:

* **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

Key steps performed:

* Handling missing values
* Converting incorrect data types
* Removing duplicates
* Standardizing columns
* Creating calculated fields
* Exporting the final cleaned dataset as `cleaned_dataset.xlsx`

📁 **Cleaned Dataset Used:**
`cleaned_dataset.xlsx` (uploaded in the repository)

---

### **2. Power BI Dashboard**

Using the cleaned dataset, a fully interactive **Power BI Sales Dashboard** was created.
The dashboard includes:

* **Total Orders**
* **Total Customers**
* **Total Sales**
* **Sales by Segment (Donut Chart)**
* **Sales by Category (Bar Chart)**
* **Sales by City (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
* **Slicers/Filters**:

  * Order Date
  * City
  * Ship Mode
  * Segment
  * Sub-Category
